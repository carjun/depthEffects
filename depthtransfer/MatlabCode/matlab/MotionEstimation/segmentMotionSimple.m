function moseg = segmentMotionSimple( imgs, flows )
%SEGMENTMOTIONSIMPLE Performs a binary segmentation of moving pixels
% Estimates pixels moving relative to the camera by thresholding the 
% optical flow. 
%
% Input:
%  imgs  - Image/video data of size [height x width x {1,3} x numFrames]
%  flows - Optical flow data corresponding to imgs
% Output:
%  moseg - Binary motion segmentation of estimated moving pixels in imgs of 
%          size [height x width x 1 x numFrames]
