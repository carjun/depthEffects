This MATLAB software accompanies our ECCV'12 paper:

K. Karsch, C. Liu and S.B. Kang. "Depth Extraction from Video Using 
Non-parametric Sampling." ECCV 2012.

Descriptions of parameters and implementation details can be found in the 
paper and supplementary material (available at

if you use our code for your research.

I.   Installation
Pre-mexed binaries for Windows (32b and 64b), OS X (64b), and Linux (32b 
and 64b) are packaged with the code. If you're using any of those OSes, 
you should not need to compile anything. These binaries and code have
been verified with MATLAB 7.14 (2012a). 

If you need to compile the code (either on a different OS or the binary 
isn't suitable for your version of MATLAB), all you need to do is run 
'make' from a MATLAB prompt. If you run into any errors, see make.m. 

IMPORTANT: to use optical flow (motion estimation + temporal consistency), 
you must also download Ce Liu's publicly available optical flow code found 
here:
	http://people.csail.mit.edu/celiu/OpticalFlow/
Modify the path in opticalflow.m (OPTICAL_FLOW_DIR) to match the location 
that you unpacked the OpticalFlow directory (the default is to unpack to 
this directory). Note that if you are only running on single images or on 
data from our dataset (StereoRGBD Dataset), this is not necessary since the
flow has been precomputed.

II.  Getting started
To get started, take a look at demoDepthTransfer.m, or just run 
'demoDepthTransfer' from a MATLAB prompt. This runs depth transfer on a 
single image from the Make3D Range Image Dataset.

To evaluate our code on the Make3D dataset, first read the documentation 
in evaluateMake3dDataset.m and run 'evaluateMake3dDataset' from a MATLAB 
prompt.

For more advanced usage, there are several scripts in the examples 
directory (these require the optical flow module; see Installation above):
  example1.m - Demonstrates depth transfer on a static video sequence with 
               moving objects
  example2.m - Demonstrates depth transfer on a rotating video sequence
  example3.m - Demonstrates depth transfer on a sequence with varying  
               focal length and moving objects
  example4.m - If you have also downloaded our StereoRGBD dataset, this 
               example will run one of the results using our training/test
               split.

IV. Notes
- This code is not optimized for efficiency in any sense, and can take both a 
  very long time to run and a great deal of memory. Take advantage of 
  MATLAB's parallel toolbox if available (ie. 'matlabpool'), and be careful
  about the size of the input sequence. Using a project size of height=300
  and width=200, a video of 60 frames can take several GB of RAM.
