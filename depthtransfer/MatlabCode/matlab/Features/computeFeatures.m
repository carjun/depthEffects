%COMPUTEFEATURES Computes feature descriptors used for DepthTransfer candidate matching
% Input:
%  img  - 4D video/img data [height x width x {1,3} x numFrames]. Can also
%         be a cell array of 4D data.
%  flow - 4D optical flow data [height x width x 2 x numFrames]. Can also
%         be a cell array of 4D data.
% Output:
%  features - Struct containing descriptors (cell of structs if img is a 
%             cell array). See corresponding feature functions for more 
%             details (video2gist, im2gist, flow2flowgist).
