function [stitch, img_overlap, mask_overlap] = stitchImages( I )
%STITCHIMAGES Performs panoramic stitching on an image sequence (no bundle adjustment)
% Input:
%  I  - Image/video data of size [height x width x {1,3} x numFrames]
% Output:
%  stitch       - resulting panorama of size [height2 x width2 x {1,3}]
%  img_overlap  - A sequence of all warped/aligned frames. This is the
%                 result of image alignment prior to median filtering (i.e.
%                 stitch = median_filter(img_overlap, 4). Of size
%                 [height2 x width2 x {1,3} x numFrames].
%  mask_overlap - A sequence of masks indicating valid pixels to aid in
%                 median filtering. Takes a value of 1 if img_overlap 
%                 contains useable pixel data. Same size as img_overlap.
